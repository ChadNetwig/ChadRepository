Miscellaneous code for CS classes

Hey Parker, Damien, and Ali. We're going to make edits here in this branch. I believe you edit the code on your local machine and do a "pull" request when you're ready to have it considered to be merged to the code held in the main branch. There are also fancier ways of doing this collaboration through SSH command line, but I haven't done this yet to provide guidance. I'm still trying to figure all this out.

So as an exercise, why don't each of you make an edit to the code and do a pull request, which I will accept and integrate it with the main code. This way, we can figure out the routine. I may have to allow you guys as collaborators before you can do this, so these are the types of details that we'll need to overcome as we're learning to collaborate on GitHub.

Thanks,

Chad Netwig
